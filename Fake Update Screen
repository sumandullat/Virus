                                                FAKE UPDATE SCREEN


Step 1: On your friend's (or anyone else who you want to fool) open this link on their web browser -> http://fakeupdate.net/

Step 2: Press F-11 (on some machines you might have to hold down the Fn as well) to go into full screen.

Step 3: Make sure any other icon is not being displayed. For example, if they have IDM installed on their machine, the floating
        download button of IDM will be displayed. Make sure to close or hide such things.
        
Step 4: Enjoy! XD (Pressing any key on the keyboard won't have any effect. Even the ESC key will not work! On the other hand,
        pressing ENTER will cause any error screen to show, like the dreaded blue screen in windows. Just make sure that they
        do not press ALT + F-4 as this will close the browser and the prank will be revealed).
        
** The update screen lasts forever (as long as the battery doesn't die).
        
        
There are a variety of Update Screen avaialbe: Windows, iOS and even Wanna Cry (:P), etc.
